Overarching goal --> perform CAPs analysis on code writing data to see if there are differences between loops and conditionals, for example

Running CAPs using MATLAB code from TbCAPS:
1. CAP_ConsensusClustering
2. ComputeClusteringQuality
3. Kmax - valid number of kmax chosen
4. handles.K - number of clusters
5. n_rep - number of repetitions
6. percentages of positive/negative voxels to keep
7. Run_Clustering
8. computing similarity
